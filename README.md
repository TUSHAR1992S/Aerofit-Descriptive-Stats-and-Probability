# Aerofit-Descriptive-Stats-and-Probability Business Case Study Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer data for Aerofit, a leading fitness equipment brand, to identify characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company. The insights from this analysis will help Aerofit provide better product recommendations to new customers and understand differences in customer characteristics across various treadmill products.

#Business Problem
